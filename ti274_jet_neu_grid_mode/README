* Simulation

    Device: JET
    XGC Branch: 3fieldEMsolver
    Input origin : Dr. Seung-hoe Ku @ PPPL, Apr.'17
    Platform : CPU+GPU, Titan @ OLCF (ORNL)
    Batch script: xgcs.ti274_0
    
    Species : electron+main Ion(D)

    *Note that mesh is reconstructed so that PUMI formats can be obtained.
     The resultant mesh does not exactly match with the one actually used in production run.
     However, the numbers of nodes and elements in mesh are same order in ~K unit. (so mesh is almost same, not exactly though)

* Before use the input file, you MUST CHECK in `input'

    sml_input_file_dir    : directs a directory where input files are located
